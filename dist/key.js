 * Optional utility class to easily build huffman keys.

 * // Add a character to rare to appear in the source text:
 * builder.add("\x00", 0.001);
 * const encoderKey = builder.encoder;
 * const decoderKey = builder.decoder;
 * ```
 *
 * This class is really just a wrapper around the following:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const rootNode = buildHuffmanTree([["L", 5], ["o", 9], [...]]);
 * const encoderKey = makeHuffmanEncoderKey(rootNode);
 * const decoderKey = makeHuffmanDecoderKey(rootNode);
 * ```
 *
 * Thus the class isn't necessary, but a nice way to
 * abstract away from the idea of Huffman trees and
 * just focus on making keys from strings.
